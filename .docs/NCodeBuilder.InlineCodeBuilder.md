## InlineCodeBuilder Class

Provides a fluent API for building inline code snippets with conditional and repeated content.

```csharp
public sealed class InlineCodeBuilder
```

Inheritance [System.Object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/System.Object 'System.Object') &#129106; InlineCodeBuilder

### Remarks
This class is designed to simplify the construction of inline code by allowing conditional appending  
of strings, repeated operations over collections, and chaining of operations. It works in conjunction  
with the [CodeBuilder](NCodeBuilder.CodeBuilder.md 'NCodeBuilder.CodeBuilder') class to manage the underlying string construction.
